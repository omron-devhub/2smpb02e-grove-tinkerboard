# 2smpb02e-grove-tinkerboard  
It is a module for evaluating Omron sensor 2SMPB-02E with Tinker Board and a sample program when using a module.  

2SMPB-02E is a compact MEMS absolute pressure sensor with high accuracy and low current consumption.  
Built-in 24-bit ADC with low noise, it can measure atmospheric pressure with high accuracy.  
Control and output are digital methods via the I2C/SPI interface, which realizes low current consumption by automatic sleep mode.

## language
- [English](./README.md)

## Description
- grove_2smpb_02e.py  
Driver module for acquiring data from 2SMPB-02E via GrovePi+.

- sample_2smpb_02e.py  
It is a sample program that allows you to check the data acquired via the driver module on the console.

- sample_gui_2smpb_02e.py  
It is a sample program that enables you to visualize and check the data acquired via the driver module with graphs.

***DEMO:***  
When you run sample_gui_2smpb_02e.py, you can see the following graph.
